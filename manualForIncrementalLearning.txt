PCA INSTRUCTIONS

Press <Ctrl-Alt-T> to open up a new terminal window
Type "cd Documents/IncrementalLearning" (no quotes) and press <Enter>
	alternately type "cd Doc<Tab>In<Tab>" for autocomplete to do the typing for you
Type "matlab &" and press <Enter>

Now open up the file browser on the left called "Files" (second icon) and navigate to Documents->IncrementalLearning->Data where you shall create a folder called "xyz" (no quotes) where "xyz" are the participant's initials
	Alternatively, in the terminal window, type 
		"mkdir Data/xyz" where "xyz" are the participant's intitials

Once Matlab has opened type "parpool" and move on (this is a step that will save time later so it is okay if skipped)

To run the calibration and generate the PCA vectors, in the terminal windows, type
	"./generateCalibrationMatrix xyz" where "xyz" are the participant's initials
This is the part where the participant will have to do the range of motion dance
	
Back in Matlab make sure you are in home->aspelun1->Documents->IncrementalLearning and type "makeVideos" then enter "xyz" as prompted where "xyz" are the participant's initials. This will generate the videos for the users PCA motions that can be used. These are located in the folder that you previously made called "xyz" in Documents->IncrementalLearning->Data


To run the VBM portion of the experiment type
	"./VBM_7DOF xyz #" where "xyz" are the participant's initials and # is the number of degrees of freedom being used.
	
To run the PCA portion of the experiment type
	"./PCA_7DOF xyz #" where "xyz" are the participant's initials and # is the number of degrees of freedom being used.

To-do:
Get rid of parameter files and just make those the default constants
check out subplots for animations
DOF 4 is grasp
567->yaw,pitch,roll

multiple sessions per degree of freedom
move on based on being fast enough at DOF. Determine criteria
also cutoff criterion

locate fingers and lights for goals
mug on post idea for ensuring rotational DOF
